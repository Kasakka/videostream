# Video Streaming Backend

This project is an ASP.NET Core-based video streaming backend. It is designed for local development and containerized deployment using Docker. The application dynamically lists any MP4 video file placed in the `videos` folder, streams video files using HTTP range requests (allowing features like seeking), and provides a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- **Dynamic Video Listing:**
